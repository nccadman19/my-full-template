# My very first webpage

Welcome [Click Here to View First Page] (https://nccadman19.github.io/my-full-template/)

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

# Project Description

This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Gitpod & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program. (I did get bored of creating images as I got the jist of it)

# Technology

This project was written in HTML & CSS using Gitpod and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
